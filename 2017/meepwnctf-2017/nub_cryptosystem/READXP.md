### (crypto, 100 points, 22 team solved)

說明
>Quan is a nub-boi at Cryptography, but his dream is having an unbreakable cryptosystem. Could you prove him that "nub is always nub" by breaking his 'nub_cryptosystem'?

檔案

## 題解
我連個 nub_cryptosystem.py 係乜都冇睇. 
有人話係 knapsack, 咁咪 LLL 佢囉. LLL 完有一行得 0 同 1 就係答案.
